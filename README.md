# To Do List

## Dab Gang & 100Devs Folx!

This is the source of the code that James/theDabolical was helping me with, and adding to, in a couple of his streams. I have created a branch for his version of the code. You can fork it or clone it here:

## https://github.com/bomboloni/ToDo/tree/dev-guest-starring-theDabolical

Fork it if you want to play with it and possibly practice pull requests. I am happy to continue this branch for us to play with and learn on for as long as it is useful.

I know a lot of us are still new to GitHub and just starting to learn how to collaborate with others. I found a particularly useful video that is part of a playlist (part 6) that gave me a better understanding of forks and branches and pull requests and best practices when working with others. Check out the whole playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3Y9MECuxct0RMwdYcqoIjo-7ncRpTNLs).

I'm working on creating a simple to do list as a 100 Dev's project using Node.js, MongoDB, and Express.js.

As you can see, it is currently under construction.
